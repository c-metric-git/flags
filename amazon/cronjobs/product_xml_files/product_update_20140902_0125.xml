Kryolan's Aquacolor face paint is made of high quality ingredients that are of cosmetic grade. Aquacolor paints are blendable and comfortable to wear. The paints are vibrant and opaque so that your design stays distinct. Kryolan Aquacolor is ideal for face and body painting because its smooth consistency allows it to be easily blended and remain flexible. It doesn't crack once dry and dries quickly to a smudge-proof and durable finish. 

It is not recommended that Kryolan Vivid Colors be used around the eyes.
