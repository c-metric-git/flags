With dense pigmentation, Wolfe Hydrocolor Face Paints provide brilliant color and opaque coverage. They are uniquely easy to apply: they go on smoothly, evenly and do not crack once dry. The difference with Wolfe FX Hydrocolor makeup is a wax base so the colors flex with movement instead of cracking, so your face paint designs stay on longer and remain beautiful.  Under normal circumstances Wolfe face paint will not smear after it's been applied.  Paint your kids in the morning and they will remain bright and colorful all day long.  Wolfe paints are also comfortable to wear.
