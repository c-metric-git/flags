They need no water activation, just squeeze and paint.

These tubes of face paint are ideal for large events like carnivals or a large party.  If there are a lot of people to cover in one color, like a ball game, Mehron F/X tubes are ideal--just squeeze and start painting.  They also dry quickly--in less than a minute.  Once on they stay put until you wash them off with soap and water.

Mehron Face Paints are highly saturated and highly pigmented face paints of cosmetic grade.  The ingredients are FDA approved, but if skin is prone to allergies, Mehron recommends that a small patch of skin be tested with the face paint before full coverage.

Comes in a 1 ounce tube and this is good for 20  - 70 applications.
