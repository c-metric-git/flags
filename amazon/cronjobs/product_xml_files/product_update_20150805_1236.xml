One stroke from a Rainbow cake sets down a colorful base for any design.

With dense pigmentation, Wolfe Hydrocolor Face Paints provide brilliant color and opaque coverage. They are uniquely easy to apply: they go on smoothly, evenly and do not crack once dry. The difference with Wolfe FX Hydrocolor makeup is a wax base so the colors flex with movement instead of cracking, so your face paint designs stay on longer and remain beautiful.  Under normal circumstances Wolfe face paint will not smear after it's been applied.  Paint your kids in the morning and they will remain bright and colorful all day long.  Wolfe paints are also comfortable to wear.

Wolfe Rainbow cakes are strips of color, so one stroke gives you a &quot;rainbow&quot; of opportunities.  The 45 gram (1.59 ounces) size come in screw top containers and stack easily.  It is a lot of face paint and will last for a lot of faces.</Description><BulletPoint>Each 1.59 ounces (45 gm) Wolfe Rainbow Face Paint Container is good for 100-250 applications</BulletPoint><BulletPoint>Rainbow cakes are made up of strips of color like a &quot;rainbow&quot;</BulletPoint><BulletPoint>Dense pigmentation makes the essential colors brilliant and vibrant</BulletPoint><BulletPoint>Wolfe paints go on smoothly and evenly and do not crack when dry</BulletPoint><BulletPoint>Stackable containers with screw top lids</BulletPoint><ShippingWeight unitOfMeasure='LB'>1</ShippingWeight><MSRP currency='CAD'>22.470000</MSRP><Manufacturer>Wolfe FX</Manufacturer><MfrPartNumber>PE 2 RB</MfrPartNumber><SearchTerms>halloween face painting</SearchTerms><SearchTerms>fun for kids</SearchTerms><SearchTerms>water based makeup</SearchTerms><SearchTerms>child safe</SearchTerms><SearchTerms>removes with soap and water</SearchTerms><ItemType>FacePaint</ItemType><TargetAudience>unisex-children</TargetAudience></DescriptionData><ProductData><Beauty><ProductType><BeautyMisc/></ProductType></Beauty></ProductData></Product></Message></AmazonEnvelope>
