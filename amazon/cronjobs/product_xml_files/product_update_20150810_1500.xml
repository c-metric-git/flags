Just place a stencil down on the skin, apply the glue and glitter and there you have it--a glitter tattoo in no time at all. 

Blacklight glitter is bright under normal light while fluorescing under black light.

The Glitter Tattoo kits include 6 vials of cosmetic glitter, a deluxe sweeper brush, alcohol swabs and an applicator for adding details plus a 10 ml glue applicator vial. There are 24 self-adhesive Glitter Tattoos (styles will vary) and instructions that will lead you step-by-step through the process. There is also a storage case.

There is enough glitter and glue to make dozens of tattoos.  With care, the stencils can be used more than once.  You can purchase more stencils separately.

All Amerikan Body Arts polyester glitter is made in the USA and is safe for use on body and face.
