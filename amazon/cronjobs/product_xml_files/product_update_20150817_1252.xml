TAG Pearl Face Paint does not contain any metal.

TAG Face Paint is very easy to blend, soft on the skin and does not crack or peel. Most of TAGs face painting colors are great for line work and lighter face painting colors show very well even when over darker colors. TAG facepaint has a wax base, so your face painting design flexes with movement instead of cracking, remains colorful and is comfortable to wear. TAG is a very soft creamy face paint and needs less water to activate than normal face paint.

TAG face paint is hypoallergenic and made with non-toxic, skin safe ingredients.

Each 32 gram TAG Pearl Lilac Face Paint Container is good for 50-200 applications.</Description><BulletPoint>Each 32 gram TAG Face Paint Container is good for 50-200 applications</BulletPoint><BulletPoint>TAG Pearl Face Paint is a little softer than TAGs regular paints and contain Mica for a metallic sheen.
