Wolfe makeup is water based, making it easy to apply and remove--just use soap and water. Wolfe makeup is safe and non-toxic.  Since it is water based it is less likely to smear or rub off and is comfortable to wear.  It will last longer than most other face painting crayons.  Paint faces in the morning of the school fair and they'll stay on until the end.</Description><BulletPoint>Each 6 color Wolfe Face Painting Crayon Set is good for about 50-200 applications</BulletPoint><BulletPoint>The Wolfe Bright Face Paint Crayon set includes white, yellow, red, blue, green and black (note: the FDA recommends against using red, green, and purple around the eyes and blue on the lips)</BulletPoint><BulletPoint>Long lasting, easy to apply and easy to remove; just use soap and water</BulletPoint><BulletPoint>Perfect for kids; they can participate in the face painting!</BulletPoint><BulletPoint>Parrafin wax and glycerine based, less likely to smear or rub off</BulletPoint><ShippingWeight unitOfMeasure='LB'>1</ShippingWeight><MSRP currency='CAD'>6.810000</MSRP><Manufacturer>Wolfe FX</Manufacturer><MfrPartNumber>WCC-B01</MfrPartNumber><SearchTerms>halloween face painting</SearchTerms><SearchTerms>fun for kids</SearchTerms><SearchTerms>water based makeup</SearchTerms><SearchTerms>child safe</SearchTerms><SearchTerms>removes with soap and water</SearchTerms><ItemType>FacePaint</ItemType><TargetAudience>unisex-children</TargetAudience></DescriptionData><ProductData><Beauty><ProductType><BeautyMisc/></ProductType></Beauty></ProductData></Product></Message></AmazonEnvelope>
