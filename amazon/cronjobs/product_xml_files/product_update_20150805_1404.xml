This is a face paint for artists who want ease with application and creative control over color.  These are refills for the 8 and 30 color palettes.

Paradise face paints are semi-soft cake makeup co-created with Mehron by Jinny Houle, World Renowned Body Painting Artist. Paradise face paints are water activated, and because of this, the hues of the colors can be controlled by the artist.  Paradise Face Paints feature vibrant colors that dry quickly with minimal rub-off, yet are easy to blend and wash off. Paradise Makeup includes aloe and chamomile and the enriching emollients glycerin, avocado oil and cocoa butter, making them safe and gentle on skin. They have rich, vibrant, color-saturated coverage--more than ordinary makeup, yet it's water-soluble for easy soap and water removal.  

These Paradise AQ Face Paint refills are 0.25 ounces or 7 grams.
