Wolfe Metallix face paints are considered to be the best available today.

With dense pigmentation, Wolfe Hydrocolor Face Paints provide brilliant color and opaque coverage. They are uniquely easy to apply: they go on smoothly, evenly and do not crack once dry. The difference with Wolfe FX Hydrocolor makeup is a wax base so the colors flex with movement instead of cracking, so your face paint designs stay on longer and remain beautiful.  Under normal circumstances Wolfe face paint will not smear after it's been applied.  Paint your kids in the morning and they will remain bright and colorful all day long.  Wolfe paints are also comfortable to wear.

Wolfe 5 gram face paints are for refilling any Wolfe Appetizer Palette, but can also be used on their own when you only need a little of one color. Wolfe Metallic Rose face paint palette refill comes in a 0.18 ounces (5 gm) size and fits in both the 6 and 12 color Wolfe palettes.</Description><BulletPoint>Each 0.18 ounces (5 gm) Wolfe Metallic Rose Face Paint Refill Container is good for 10 applications</BulletPoint><BulletPoint>Metallic colors give a glistening effect to a face paint design</BulletPoint><BulletPoint>Wolfe paints are one of the most popular face paints on the market--they go on smoothly and evenly and do not crack when dry</BulletPoint><BulletPoint>Easy to apply and easy to remove; just use soap and water</BulletPoint><BulletPoint>Wolfe 5 gram refills work in the 6 and 12 color palettes</BulletPoint><ShippingWeight unitOfMeasure='LB'>1</ShippingWeight><MSRP currency='CAD'>9.430000</MSRP><Manufacturer>Wolfe FX</Manufacturer><MfrPartNumber>PA 1 M30</MfrPartNumber><SearchTerms>halloween face painting</SearchTerms><SearchTerms>fun for kids</SearchTerms><SearchTerms>water based makeup</SearchTerms><SearchTerms>child safe</SearchTerms><SearchTerms>removes with soap and water</SearchTerms><ItemType>FacePaint</ItemType><TargetAudience>unisex-children</TargetAudience></DescriptionData><ProductData><Beauty><ProductType><BeautyMisc/></ProductType></Beauty></ProductData></Product></Message></AmazonEnvelope>
