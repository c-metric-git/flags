These are water based rainbow striped cakes that need just a little moisture from a sponge or brush to begin.

The brilliant, multi-color Prisma Blend split cake was designed by the Canadian face and body artist Jinny - Makeup Artiste or Genevieve Houle specifically for Paradise. Each Prisma Cake has a large surface area with equal amounts of each color so they can be applied with a sponge or large brush. Each cake in the palette is 1.75 ounce.

Paradise Face Paints are moist and semi-soft cakes; the colors are vibrant dry quickly with minimal smearing, yet are easy to blend and wash off.  Paradise AQ Makeup includes aloe and chamomile and the enriching emollients glycerin, avocado oil and cocoa butter, making them especially safe and gentle on skin, Paradise AQ Makeup has a richer more color-saturated coverage than ordinary makeup yet it's water-soluble for easy application and clean up.
